# Project Overview

Welcome to the **AdVeris**! AdVeris is a system designed to streamline the process of managing and ensuring the quality of real estate advertisements. It leverages web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to extract, process, and verify advertisement data. This project consists of three main services, each with its own set of documentation. Below is a brief overview of the project and its structure:
